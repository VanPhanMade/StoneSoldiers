Stone Soldiers takes place in a fantasy world, where your habits extend and manifest into magic. Farmers manipulate the growth of crops, soldiers can enchant their physical prowess, and sculptors can shape the lands. However, with such power, there is the ever growing greed for more control. Nations have trained elite soldiers known as Stone Casters, who dedicate their entire lives to manipulating magic to be further extension of their maigc strength, to lead the charge with powerful, magic controlled, golems. The golems have marked the end of a once peaceful era, to now a dark point in history where everyday life is filled with battles, raids, and dark magic.
